# SideCrab hooks

`settings-hooks-fragment.json` is the `hooks` object merged into `~/.claude/settings.json`
by `setup/Install-SideCrab.ps1`. It carries two kinds of entry.

## The six fire-and-forget `command` hooks

`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Notification`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`,
`SessionEnd` each pipe the hook JSON that Claude Code puts on stdin straight to crabd:

```
curl.exe -s -m 2 -X POST --data-binary @- http://127.0.0.1:2722/v1/hook || exit 0
```

- `curl.exe` is the Windows-native one in `C:\Windows\System32` — not Git Bash's.
- `-m 2` caps the whole call at 2 s; a refused connection fails in microseconds.
- `|| exit 0` swallows curl's exit code so a stopped crabd can never surface an error
  in Claude Code. `exit 0` behaves the same under `cmd.exe` and any POSIX shell.
- `--data-binary @-` streams stdin. curl buffers it and sends `Content-Length`, but
  crabd accepts chunked framing too.

**`SubagentStart` joined in crabd 0.31.2 (SUB-c).** Without it `running` was an ESTIMATE -
subagent files touched in the last 90 s minus a bare count of recent `SubagentStop`s - and on
a dispatcher whose lanes turn over every ~30 s that arithmetic sits at zero: measured, a badge
reading `0/34` on a session with a subagent file written one second earlier. With both halves
crabd keeps an exact balance instead. It is fire-and-forget like the rest and moves no state:
a lane opening says nothing new about the SESSION, which is already working by virtue of
having launched it. An operator who does not add it keeps the old estimate and loses nothing.

**No `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`, deliberately (v0.19.0).** They were the obvious way to tell the
panel a session is alive again after the operator answers a permission dialog in the app — and they
were rejected: they would put an HTTP round trip in front of every tool call in every session, on a
machine whose loopback drops SYN-ACKs. crabd reads that same evidence out of the transcript it
already parses. See `docs/STATE-CONTRACT.md` v0.19.0 §2 and §4.

## The two `type: "http"` hooks (v0.12.0 — the control-surface wave)

`Stop` and `PermissionRequest` are `type: "http"` entries — Claude Code POSTs the hook's
stdin JSON to the `url` itself (Content-Type `application/json`) and READS THE RESPONSE as
the hook's decision. Unlike the curl hooks these are two-way: crabd answers.

```jsonc
"Stop":              { "type": "http", "url": ".../v1/hook/stop",       "timeout": 5  }
"PermissionRequest": { "type": "http", "url": ".../v1/hook/permission", "timeout": 60 }
```

- **Stop → `/v1/hook/stop`.** crabd answers within ~2 s: `{}` to let Claude stop, or
  `{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"Stop","additionalContext":"<prompt>"}}` to feed a
  tap-to-continue prompt back in as NON-ERROR feedback (the conversation continues so the model
  can act on it — the binary's own schema text). `decision:"block"` also continues but paints
  "Stop hook error occurred" and labels the nudge an error to the model; it is retained in crabd
  as an executable fallback only. This
  replaces the former `Stop` curl entry — crabd records the done-transition on this endpoint
  now (docs\STATE-CONTRACT.md, v0.12.0 item 3). `timeout` 5 s bounds crabd's 2 s answer.
- **PermissionRequest → `/v1/hook/permission`.** crabd long-polls (up to 55 s) for an
  Approve/Deny tap from the widget, then returns
  `{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PermissionRequest","decision":{"behavior":"allow"|"deny"}}}`.
  On no-tap / timeout / `panelApprovals` disabled it returns **no `hookSpecificOutput`** (`{}`), so
  the terminal dialog appears exactly as today — it NEVER auto-allows (docs\STATE-CONTRACT.md,
  v0.12.0 item 4). `timeout` 60 s sits just past crabd's 55 s poll.

**Fail-open by design.** An HTTP hook whose endpoint is refused, errors, or times out
returns `ok:false` inside Claude Code and does NOT block: a stopped crabd means Claude
stops normally and permission falls back to the terminal dialog. Nothing about crabd being
down can wedge a session.

## Verified against the shipped Claude Code (claude.exe v2.1.246, 2026-08-26)

Confirmed by inspecting the shipped binary (a Bun-compiled `claude.exe`) and
docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks:

- Hook handler `type` accepts `command`, **`http`**, `mcp_tool`, `prompt`, `agent`. The
  `http` handler config carries `url` (not `command`) and a `timeout` in **seconds**
  (default 600). It POSTs the stdin document as the request body.
- **HTTP hooks are skipped only for `SessionStart` and `Setup`** (the binary logs
  "HTTP hooks are not supported for" those two) — `Stop` and `PermissionRequest` both allow
  them, which is why the five ingest hooks above stay on curl and only these two are `http`.
- **Stop** continuation: BOTH `additionalContext` (non-error, shipped) and top-level
  `decision:"block"` (error-labelled, fallback) push into the same continuation array — the
  forced turn is guaranteed either way; only the labelling differs. `continuationPrompt` does
  not exist (measured 0 occurrences).
- **PermissionRequest** decides via `hookSpecificOutput.decision.{behavior: "allow"|"deny"}`
  (the shipped zod schema; NOT the PreToolUse-style `permissionDecision` string, and there is no
  `"ask"` value — the pass-through is to omit `hookSpecificOutput` entirely). An earlier
  docs-based note here read `permissionDecision:allow|deny|ask`; corrected against the binary.
- Optional `allowedHttpHookUrls` setting: if the operator has configured it, it must include
  `http://127.0.0.1:2722/*` or these two hooks are blocked ("HTTP hook blocked: … does not
  match any pattern in allowedHttpHookUrls"). Unset (the default) allows all URLs.

## The status-line command (v0.12.0)

`hooks/sidecrab_statusline.py` is installed as the `statusLine` command, not as a hook. It
POSTs the official status-line stdin document to `/v1/statusline` (fire-and-forget) and then
**chains** to any status-line command the operator already had — the installer saves it to
`~/.sidecrab/statusline-chain.json` and the uninstaller restores it. See the module
docstring and `setup/Install-SideCrab.ps1`.

## The merge marker

Events and what crabd does with them are in `docs/STATE-CONTRACT.md`. Install/uninstall
match SideCrab's own entries on the `127.0.0.1:2722/v1/hook` substring — which the `http`
URLs (`…/v1/hook/stop`, `…/v1/hook/permission`) contain as a prefix, so the same marker
finds both the `command` (`.command`) and `http` (`.url`) entries and leaves every other
hook alone.
